# ML-CNN-TSR
We aim to develop Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with the overall goal to identify and distinguish traffic signs accurately. The program will take a still image containing a road sign (in any orientation) as input and produce a classification as output.

The official training data (use this to train your model):
 - Images and annotations (GTSRB_Final_Training_Images.zip)
 - Three sets of different HOG features (GTSRB_Final_Training_HOG.zip)
 - Haar-like features (GTSRB_Final_Training_Haar.zip)
 - Hue histograms (GTSRB_Final_Training_HueHist.zip)

The official test dataset (use this to test your model):
 - Images and annotations (without ground truth classes) (GTSRB_Final_Test_Images.zip)
 - Extended ground truth annotations (with classes) (GTSRB_Final_Test_GT.zip)
 - Three sets of different HOG features (GTSRB_Final_Test_HOG.zip)
 - Haar-like features (GTSRB_Final_Test_Haar.zip)
 - Hue histograms (GTSRB_Final_Test_HueHist.zip)
