# ML-CNN-TSR
We aim to develop Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with the overall goal to identify and distinguish traffic signs accurately. The program will take a still image containing a road sign (in any orientation) as input and produce a classification as output.
